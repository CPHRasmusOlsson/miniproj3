# miniproj3

I used linear regression and multiple linear regression

I had a hard time knowing exactly what data was useless and what wasn't

my solution was not very accurate with a R2 score of 0.546..

to improve my accuracy i would have to use more time exploring the data and figuring out what would be the most useful to use
